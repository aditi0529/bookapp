DATABASE CONECTIVITY
===================
1.Python -mysqlclient- write queries
"insert into book (%s %s %s)".(t,a,p)

table creation-python datatypes- db types

-->Table creation
-->migration- switching db is easy through ORM, as our code doesnt need changes,
only db configuration needs to be updated
-->object to values and values to object conversion was required
-->relationships

2.ORM
===
Object Relational Mapping
model class - table
inbuilt methods to perform DML,DQL operations

a.model class
Book table
id,title,author,price..(it will dd id by itself)

class Book()
title =models.CharField(max_length=30)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    price = models.IntegerField()

b. create DATABASE
c. settings.py add db settings
d. pip install mysqlclient 
e.settings.py -->installed apps
add ur application
f.python manage.py makemigrations
g.python manage.py migrate


we can verify multiple tables are created in db.
one of that is
bookapp_book
applicationName_modeClassName
